# MERN Todo List (Basic)

A minimal Todo app using the MERN stack:

- Frontend: React (Vite) in `src/`
- Backend: Node/Express in `server/`
- Database: MongoDB

No external URLs/APIs are used.

# MERN Todo List

A minimal, well-documented To‑Do application built with the MERN stack (React + Vite frontend, Express backend, MongoDB database). This repository contains a small, production-ready example you can run locally or deploy.

## 🌟 Features

- Create new todos with a simple input
- List todos (newest first)
- Delete todos
- Persistent storage using MongoDB (via Mongoose)
- Small, focused REST API (`/api/todos`) that the React frontend consumes
- Fast frontend dev experience powered by Vite + React
- Tiny codebase suitable for learning, demos, and Hacktober contributions

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- Frontend: React + Vite + TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS (configured in the project)
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Database: MongoDB (Mongoose ODM)
- Dev tools: dotenv, nodemon-like watch via `node --watch`

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- A MongoDB connection string (MongoDB Atlas or local)

## 🚀 Quick Start

Follow these steps to run the project locally. There are two parts: the backend API and the frontend app. Both live under the `App/` folder.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/debugfest/mern-todo-list.git
cd mern-todo-list
```

### 2. Backend (API)

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
cd App/server
npm install
# Create a .env file in App/server with at least:
# MONGODB_URI='your-mongodb-connection-string'
# PORT=5000     # optional, defaults to 5000

# Start the server in watch mode
npm run dev
```

The API endpoints will be available at http://localhost:5000/api/todos by default.

Available endpoints:

- GET /api/todos — fetch all todos (sorted newest first)
- POST /api/todos — create a todo (body: `{ "text": "..." }`)
- DELETE /api/todos/:id — delete a todo by id

### 3. Frontend (React + Vite)

Open another terminal and run:

```bash
cd App
npm install
npm run dev
```

Vite will print the local dev URL (usually http://localhost:5173). Open it to use the app.

## 🧠 How it works

### Data Model

The `Todo` model (see `App/server/models/Todo.js`) has:

- `text` (String, required) — the task description
- `createdAt` (Date) — timestamp, defaults to now

### API Flow

1. Frontend calls the REST API under `/api/todos`.
2. The backend (Express) uses Mongoose to read/write documents in MongoDB.
3. Todos are returned to the client as JSON and rendered in the React UI.

The main server file is `App/server/server.js` and exposes the routes listed in "Quick Start".

## 🔒 Environment & Security

- Keep your MongoDB connection string and other secrets out of version control. Add `App/server/.env` to your local environment (it's already listed as local-only in the repo).
- Example `.env`:

```env
MONGODB_URI='your-mongodb-connection-string'
PORT=5000
```

## 📦 Deployment

Local development is covered above. For production you can:

- Build the frontend with `cd App && npm run build` and serve the static files from a static host (Vercel, Netlify, or a simple Express static server).
- Deploy the API to a Node host (Render, Railway, DigitalOcean App Platform). Make sure to set `MONGODB_URI` in the host's environment settings.
- Optionally combine by serving the frontend build from the Express server and running the combined app on a single host.
